# UniProjects
Some of the projects that I worked on in University 

AI 
1. Created a program to solve a space search problem using A*Search.
2. Researched on other search algorithms and came to conclusion of A*Search usage
3. Program will search through the rooms for the rubbish and clear out all the rubbish by emptying it via disposal rooms
4. Set of rules were always in play so the person clearing the rubbish will have to respect the rules

Computational Intelligence , A year 3 elective of AI Studies. 
1. Worked with Fuzzy System to create a create a system that is assisting with one of the SDGs
2. Constructed a neural network on a real world datatset with 3D visualization , Earthquake Database was selected therefore the neural network aims to predict earthquakes

DIP
1. Created a program to process video and then from there detect faces of humans and blur out the faces
2. Created another program that is able to extract paragraphs out of a page of paragraphs into individual paragraphs


Distributed System
Part 1 
1. A simple multi threaded Distributed System to have a client send an ISBN value to a server to process if it is true and communicate with client is implemented. The server can run multiple client request concurrently

Part 2 
1. Turned a scala program into a Distributed Scala Program using AKKA
2. Created and modified page design using JavaFX SceneBuilder
3. The Distributed Program is a MasterMind Game with up to four players

Summary of Game ( Mastermind )
Players may enter name on game start and they will enter a lobby page. After that they will be prompted to the Lobby Page in which they may make rooms or join rooms of other players. In cases that rooms are not updated,
there is a refresh button to refresh the view of the page to update the rooms in the lobby. On entering the Game page players are able to view other players name as they enter and anyone in the room may start the game at 
any moment, on Start button trigger players are transitioned into the Game page where they will be able to play the game. When a player sends their clue they will get a return of clue and list of their past guesses. The guesses of every player will be based off a universal code shared by all players as soon as the game starts. After player wins , they will be passed to the Leaderboard room to view their results and each players will have their score passed in to update the leaderboard. In cases that other players cannot see the scores of other players or it is not being updated there is also a refresh button. When "Ok" is pressed, players will go back to the lobby for their next game.

React Native App
1. Created App Design with Figma
2. Conducted learning on React Native framework and typescript programming
3. App was created and coded
4. Expo Go was used to test the app out and for debugging

Overall Summary of App Usage
Users will be prompted a Starting page, which they can use to enter the main menu which they will be able to view and use the functionality in it to enter a profile page or the prompt generation page. In prompt generation there is a text box in which users can enter their prompt and then they can submit it or they may press the history button which navigates the user to the prompt history page where users can view the past prompts. If submit button with the right logic in text box was entered and submitted , the users will enter the Generated page with a button to view the prompt generated and a button to copy the prompt. Users may copy the prompt as well in the history page by holding onto the prompts. A few QA tests were done to assure the quality of the user experience as they used the app.
